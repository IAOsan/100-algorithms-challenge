**Example**

-   For n = 88, the output should be
    mostFrequentDigitSum(n) = 9.

Here is the first sequence you built: 88, 72, 63, 54, 45, 36, 27, 18, 9, 0;

And here is s(x) for each of its elements: 16, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0.

As you can see, the most frequent number in the second sequence is 9.

-   For n = 8, the output should be
    mostFrequentDigitSum(n) = 8.

At first you built the following sequence: 8, 0

s(x) for each of its elements is: 8, 0

As you can see, the answer is 8 (it appears as often as 0, but is greater than it).

**Hints**

-   toString()
-   split()
-   parseInt()
-   hasOwnProperty()

**Input/Output**

-   **[execution time limit] 5 seconds (ts)**
-   **[input] integer n**

_Guaranteed constraints:_

1 ≤ n ≤ 105,

-   **[output] integer**

The most frequent number in the sequence s(n), s(step(n)), s(step(step(n))), etc.
